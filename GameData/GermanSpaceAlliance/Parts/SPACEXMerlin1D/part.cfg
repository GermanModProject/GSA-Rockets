description = The Merlin 1D engine was developed by SpaceX in 2011–2012, with first flight in 2013.  The engine has the highest specific impulse ever achieved for a gas-generator cycle kerosene rocket engine. On March 20, 2013 SpaceX announced the Merlin 1D engine has achieved flight qualification. In June 2013, the first orbital flight vehicle to use the Merlin 1D, the Falcon 9 1.1 first stage, completed development testing. On November 24, 2013, during a joint teleconference of SES and SpaceX regarding the SES-8 launch, Kelon Musk stated that the engine was actually operating at 85% of its potential, and they anticipated to be able to increase the sea level thrust.
